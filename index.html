           <h3>Sample Amusement Park UI/UX for Website and App + Social Media Campaign</h3>
            <p>This project was for a BPA competition in which the prompt required a proper website landing page with 4-5 working links to other pages. 
                The prompt also required a mobile app demo which allows many of the functionalities of the website to be accessible on the mobile app. Finally 
                a social media campaign was required with examples of instagram posts and tiktok videos which would generate good advertising and hype for the amusement park. 
                Overall this project was very successful as we placed first in the regional and state levels, becoming finalists at the national level. The graphics
                were designed using Canva and the UI demonstration of the app and website were made on Adobe XD.
